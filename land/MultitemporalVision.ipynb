    "In this tutorial we will use the WEkEO Jupyterhub to access and analyse data from the Copernicus Sentinel satellites and products from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS). A region in northern Corsica has been selected as it contains representative landscape features and process elements which can be used to demonstrate the capabilities and strengths of Copernicus space component and services. In this case we will be studying a fire event from 2017 which occurred in the Olmeta-di-Tuda commune in the Haute-Corse department.\n",

    "EO images are great at capturing information over large areas in a synoptic or snap-shot fashion, but single images only provide a status and no indication of the dynamics of the landscape. Multiple images allow the identification of changes if the phenomenon of interest has a visible expression in the data. The combination of images from multiple dates in a single visualisation can often show changes without need for detailed analysis of the individual acquisitions.\n",

    "The tutorial thus comprises the following steps:\n",

There are currently two Sentinel-2 satellites in suitably phased orbits to give a revisit period of 5 days at the Equator and 2-3 days at European latitudes. Being an optical sensor they are of course also affected by cloud cover and illumination conditions. The Sentinel-2 images are useful as a site reference image.

For this training session we will only need a composite true colour image (made up of the blue green and red bands).\n",
