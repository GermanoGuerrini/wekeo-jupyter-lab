    "**What is this notebook for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to download an OLCI EFR (full-resolution level-1) scene using the harmonised data access API and plot it to the screen. It will walk you through some options for how handle the data, how to convert the radiometry channels to RGB, and how to re-project and plot. It also provides some tricks and tips for plotting imagery of this kind - such as how to make the image more visually appealing. Although it is developed specifically for OLCI, you could use the basis of this script for any RGB channel data (e.g. Sentinel-2 MSI, Sentinel-3 SLSTR, Sentinel-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What specific tools does this notebook use?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond general Python modules, this notebook imports some functions for managing the harmonised data access api (harmonised_data_access_api_tools.py) which can be found in the wekeo-hda folder on JupyterLab and some functions for helping us to plot data (image_tools.py).\n",

    "**What are Cyanobacteria blooms and how can Copernicus data be used to observe them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyanobacteria are found in environments around the world, and are one of the oldest groups of species on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "They photosynthesize, absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen, and are thought to be the modern day progeny of the ancestors of all plants, and much of life itself. Ancient cyanobacterial species changed the face of our planet during the Great Oxygenation Event, which caused mass extinction of early anaerobic lifeforms, and paved the way for all life that depends on the current atmospheric composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are troublemakers in both historical and modern contexts, with blooms of cyanobacteria in coastal and fresh waters being linked to various health impacts in humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can proliferate widely, particularly during summer periods where warm temperatures and calm weather lead to calm seas. They are small, and sometimes contain gas bubbles within their structure to help them float on the surface of the waters they inhabit. These combined factors make blooms of cyanobacteria very clear to view from space in certain regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copernicus data can be used both to identify these blooms (they contain chlorophyll-a pigments, and often internal structures that make them clearly visible in optical imagery) and understand the physical drivers of their formation and progression (through indications of stratification and ocean currents).\n",
